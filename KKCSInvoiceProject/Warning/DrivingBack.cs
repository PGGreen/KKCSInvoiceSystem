We are open one hour before each incoming flight, and we close after the flight has

there are delays.

If you are going to be outside these hours, you will need to either pick up the car on
the next flight or on the next day.

For the final plane (normally 2025) we are open 5 minutes before the plane arrives and
only IF we have customers coming in, otherwise we will be closed.
